# evilmando
the very first custom enemy for Risk of Rain Returns. uses mostly commando's graphics and skills, with the exception of his primary which is a custom skill, because strafing skills are very broken on enemies
should fully work in multiplayer.

roughly 25% chance to spawn with alt loadout.

was intended as a reference for learning, though after updating it the code is rather messy, sorry.
